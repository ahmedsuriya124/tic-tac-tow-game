This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with either X or O. The game automatically checks for a winner after every move and declares the result. If the board is full and no one wins, the game ends in a draw. The simple and clean user interface ensures an enjoyable experience for players.

**Features:**

1. Two-player mode (player vs. player)
2. Interactive 3x3 grid with clickable cells
3. Automatic winner detection (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal)
4. Draw detection when the board is full
5. Reset button to reset the game
